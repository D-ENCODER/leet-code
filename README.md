# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

I'm a Data Analyst and I am developing my skills in Data Science and Machine Learning. I started with Basics of Python in my free time, messed with errors and bugs, took help from the internet, and sometimes also my friends helped me. I then cracked some competitive stuff, and started developing my very own Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modal with python, and Aha! I made one. Now I decided to help my fellow learners to understand the logic behind every competitive problem so I started with one of the most popular competitive stuff providers Leet Code. I'll provide solutions to all the Leet Code problems here so be with me and let's dive deep!!
