# 🎧 16. 3Sum Closest

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

Return _the sum of the three integers_.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
</strong><strong>Output: 2
</strong><strong>Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
</strong><strong>Output: 0
</strong><strong>Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= nums.length <= 500`
* `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
* `-104 <= target <= 104`

### **Solution**

solution will be available 24 hours from now till then keep trying......
