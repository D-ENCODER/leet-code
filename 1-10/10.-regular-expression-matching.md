# 🎧 10. Regular Expression Matching



Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:

* `'.'` Matches any single character.​​​​
* `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 20`
* `1 <= p.length <= 30`
* `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
* `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.
* It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.
